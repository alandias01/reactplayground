commands
npm -v
npm install npm@latest -g

See whats installed globally
npm list -g --depth 0

You dont want create-react-app installed globally so remove
npm uninstall -g create-react-app

npx create-react-app my-app --typescript

Adding typescript to an existing create-react-app
npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
Next, rename any file to be a TypeScript file (e.g. src/index.js to src/index.tsx)
